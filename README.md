# Devil's Advocate Project

---

My thoughts on this project were, instead of choosing one topic to advocate for, why don't I allow a space where all opinions can be advocated for.

I know this is somewhat of a loose interpretation of the project, however it was the first thing that really popped out to me, so I decided to go for it.

This project is not completed at this moment but below are a list of things that I need to do in order for it to get closer to completion.

The final project should work as follows:

## How this should work

Opening page that gives information to the user about the project & how to use it. It should have buttons that link to the particular issue at hand.

On the page that contains those particular issues I want there to be a set of questions, one at a time, that the user can answer.

These questions have data associated with them based on information received when polled by the initial source (likely going to be Pew Research Group).

Then I want there to be a chart at the lower portion of the screen, & when the user submits their answer I want the chart to populate with the data that shows the percentage of people that selected each answer. (not yet implemented, however know how & can be soon)

Next I want there to be a resource (currently don't know how to implement this, but should figure it out after the chart is completed) that will give the user information on the choose & show them the reasoning as to why someone else picked the answer that is different than the one that the user selected.

This logic should work for each question & then at the end of the quiz the user can select to go back to the main page or to another set of questions.

<!--TODO:-->

- [ ] Complete all the question sets
- [ ] Add the chart
- [ ] Get chart to populate when user submits
- [ ] Make the website as a whole prettier & neater in appearance
